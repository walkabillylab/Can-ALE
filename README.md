# Can-ALE
The Canadian Active Living Environments (Can-ALE) database is a geographic-based set of measures that represents the active living friendliness of Canadian communities. The primary envisioned use for Can-ALE is research and analysis of the relationship between the way communities are built and the physical activity levels of Canadians.
