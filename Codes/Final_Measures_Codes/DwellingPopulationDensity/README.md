# Population and Dwelling Density Calculation

This project provides a high-precision method for calculating **population** and **private dwelling densities** within a 1-kilometer radius of a Dissemination Area's (DA) population-weighted centroid.

Compared to earlier approaches (e.g., Can-ALE), this method improves accuracy by using **Dissemination Block (DB)** level census data‚Äîthe smallest geographic unit available‚Äîproviding a finer spatial distribution of population and dwellings.

## üìÇ Data Sources

The analysis requires three key datasets:

1. **Census Data (DB level)**  
   - Population and private dwelling counts at the DB level.  
   - Retrieved using the [`cancensus`](https://github.com/mountainMath/cancensus) package.  
   - Requires a CensusMapper API key ([Sign up here](https://censusmapper.ca/users/sign_up)).

2. **Dissemination Block Shapefiles**  
   - Geographic boundary files for DBs.  
   - Used for spatial intersections.

3. **Population-Weighted Centroids**  
   - Pre-calculated file containing a population-weighted centroid for each DA.  
   - Serves as the buffer center to represent where people are concentrated within each DA.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. Buffer Creation
- Generate a **1 km radius buffer** around each DA centroid.  
- Represents the analysis area for population and dwelling density calculations.

### 2. Areal Interpolation Using DBs
- **Intersection**: Identify all DB polygons intersecting each buffer.  
- **Proportional Allocation**: For DBs partially inside the buffer, calculate the proportion of area that overlaps.  
- **Estimation**: Attribute population and dwelling counts proportionally.  
  - Example: If 30% of a DB lies inside a buffer, 30% of its population and dwellings are assigned to that buffer.

### 3. Density Calculation
- Sum proportionally allocated **population** and **dwelling counts** from all intersecting DBs.  
- Divide totals by buffer area (œÄ √ó (1 km)¬≤ ‚âà 3.14 km¬≤) to produce:  
  - **Population Density (people/km¬≤)**  
  - **Dwelling Density (dwellings/km¬≤)**

## üìå Key Assumption
- Population and dwellings are assumed to be **uniformly distributed within each DB**.  
- Since DBs are very small (often a few city blocks), this assumption is **much more reliable** than applying it at the DA level.

## üöÄ Applications
- Urban and transportation planning.  
- Accessibility and land use studies.  
- Public health and environmental exposure research.  

---

## üîë Requirements
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)  
- [`cancensus`](https://github.com/mountainMath/cancensus) package  
- Shapefiles for Dissemination Blocks  
- Pre-computed population-weighted DA centroids

Would you like me to also **add a usage example with R code** (using `cancensus` and `sf`) so the README is more practical for GitHub?
