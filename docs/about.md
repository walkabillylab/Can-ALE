## Methodology

The updated Active Living Environment (ALE) index was calculated using five core measures:

1.  **Weighted Population Density** & **Weighted Dwelling Density**
    * [View the R Code](https://github.com/walkabillylab/Can-ALE/tree/Can-ALE-2.0/Codes/Final_Measures_Codes/DwellingPopulationDensity) used for this calculation.
    * [See the final data output](https://github.com/walkabillylab/Can-ALE/tree/Can-ALE-2.0/Data/DwellingPopulation) in this folder.

2.  **Weighted Dwelling Density**
3.  **Transit Stops**
4.  **Intersection Density** (â‰¥3 legs)
5.  **Weighted Points of Interest (POI)**

This work is a replication and extension of the original Can-ALE project for the 2006 and 2016 census years.
