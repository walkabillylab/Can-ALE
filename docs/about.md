## Methodology

The updated Active Living Environment (ALE) index was calculated using five core measures:

1.  **Weighted Population Density**
2.  **Weighted Dwelling Density**
3.  **Transit Stops**
4.  **Intersection Density** (â‰¥3 legs)
5.  **Weighted Points of Interest (POI)**

This work is a replication and extension of the original Can-ALE project for the 2006 and 2016 census years.
