## Supplementary Appendix 2 – Walking and Active Transportation

Supplementary Appendix 2 shows the descriptive statistics for walking to work and active transportation to work percentages, stratified by the 5 ALE classes for each year (2011, 2016, 2021).

Table S.2.1, represents descriptive statistics of Walk-to-Work and Active-Transportation-to-Work Rates across ALE groups, more granular details can be found supporting earlier findings.

Walk-to-work rates stayed relatively modest in Groups 1–4, ranging from roughly 3% to 6% across the three census years, but rose sharply in Group 5, increasing from 15% in 2011 to 17% in 2021. Active transport to work rates, including walking, cycling, and transit use, exhibited a much steeper gradient, starting from 13–18% in Group 1 and climbing to approximately 56% in 2011, 59% in 2016, and 50% in 2021 for Group 5. Across all ALE groups, active commuting rates generally improved between 2011 and 2016, followed by a decline in 2021 that was more evident in higher ALE categories (Groups 3–5). This shift may be partially explained by pandemic-related changes to commuting behaviors, such as increased remote work and reduced transit use, which affected active transportation levels even in neighborhoods typically supportive of non-motorized travel.

Examining each specific measure separately across different years reveals a varying gradient among the groups.
To provide a clearer understanding of these changes, the 2016 analysis is presented in detail as a representative example.
In 2016, the average number of intersections with three or more legs per DA varies greatly from about 2.48 intersections (Group 1) to 65.9 intersections (Group 5).
This result suggests that areas with better ALE indexes are associated with more connected street networks, which is more conducive to non-motorized transportation, as a higher number of intersections is associated with shorter routes, increased crossing opportunities, and slower vehicle speeds, thereby making these areas safer and more convenient for pedestrians and cyclists.
Weighted dwelling density as an indicator of concentration of housing also follows a similar trend with about 33 dwellings per DA associated more in rural and suburban fringe areas.
Conversely, Group 5 areas, including CBDs and other dense urban cores, were found to have an average of about 4819 dwellings per DA.
This distinct contrast implies a strong correlation between urban density and the favorable conditions for active transport.
Weighted Points of interest (POIs), which represent amenities that potentially encourage active travel, also show substantial variability.
The average number of POIs increases from about 1.5 in Group 1 to approximately 315 in Group 5, reinforcing the connection between the availability of local amenities and neighborhood walkability.
The presence of public transportation stops similarly aligns with the ALE classification.
Average transit stop counts rise sharply from about 8 stops per DA in Group 1 neighborhoods to roughly 90 stops per DA in Group 5, highlighting how better accessibility to public transportation complements higher active transportation rates.

## Supplementary Appendix 4

Figure S.4 shows a confusion matrix of the old and new ALE and ALE Transit classes separately.
As can be seen in Figure S.4 (a), Classes 1 and 5 exhibited the least change, whereas Class 3 showed the greatest shift, mainly moving one level down or up.
On the other hand, as shown in the ALE Transit Class plot (Figure S.4 (b)), the greatest changes occurred in Classes 1 and 2, while Class 5 exhibited the least change.
This suggests that the changes made in the calculation process and reasons including the shift to population-weighted centroids from geometric centroid, the use of different underlying data sources for transit and road networks, and a more precise, automated R-developed workflow, as mentioned earlier in detail in the comparative analysis section, caused these slight changes.
